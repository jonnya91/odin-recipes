   <h1>Spaghetti Carbonara</h1> 
   <img src="../img/carbonara.jpg">

   <h3>Description</h3>

   <p>Make the ultimate spaghetti carbonara with a creamy 
    hollandaise-style sauce and crisp pancetta or guanciale. 
    You can also mix in an egg yolk at the end.


   </p>

   <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>150g rindless unsmoked fatty pancetta or 
            guanciale, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, bashed</li>
        <li>200g spaghetti or fettuccine</li>
        <li>4 good quality egg yolks</li>
        <li>50g parmesan</li>
        <li>truffle oil</li>
    </ul>

   <ol>
        <li>Warm serving dishes, heat oil gently in a large,
            shallow pan. Fry the guanciale or pancetta and
            garlic for 10 mins, or until all fat rendered off
            and the meat is gold and crisp. Remove garlic clove,
            then turn on the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pan of salted water to a simmer and 
            cook the pasta until it’s al dente (about a minute
            less than the pack instructions). 
            Meanwhile, whisk 2 egg yolks in a small bowl with 
            a pinch of salt.
        </li>
        <li>Using kitchen tongs, lift the pasta from the water
            into the pancetta pan along with any dripping water. 
            Use a wooden spoon to stir it into the rendered fat. 
            If the pan looks dry, add a small ladleful of pasta 
            water and mix it in. Keep adding until you see a 
            little pasta water at the bottom of the pan – you’ll 
            be surprised how much will be absorbed.
        </li>
        <li>Working quickly, tip the beaten yolks in with the 
            pasta and stir vigorously. Rinse the yolk bowl out 
            with a little more pasta water and pour that in too. 
            Add most of the parmesan and beat again. If at any 
            time it’s becoming claggy or starting to scramble, 
            pour in a little more water. If you’ve added too much, 
            stir the pasta over the lowest heat for a few moments. 
            You’re aiming for a smooth sauce that is the 
            consistency of double cream. Season with a couple of 
            pinches of ground black pepper and taste for salt.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer the pasta to the warmed serving dishes, 
            scatter over the remaining parmesan and nestle the last
            two egg yolks on top, if using. Season them with some 
            salt and pepper, and drizzle 
            over the truffle oil, if you have it, just before serving.
   </ol>
