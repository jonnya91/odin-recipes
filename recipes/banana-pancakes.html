   </p>

   <ul>
        <li>350g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 very ripe bananas</li>
        <li>2 medium eggs</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>250ml whole milk</li>
        <li>butter, for frying</li>
   </ul>

   <ol>
        <li>Sieve the flour, baking powder and a generous pinch of 
            salt into a large bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, 
            mash the very ripe bananas with a fork until smooth, 
            then whisk in the eggs, vanilla extract and milk. Make 
            a well in the centre of the dry ingredients, tip in the 
            wet ingredients and 
            swiftly whisk together to create a smooth, silky batter.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a little knob of butter in a large non-stick pan 
            over a medium heat. Add 2-3 tbsp of the batter to the 
            pan and cook for several minutes, or until small 
            bubbles start appearing on the surface. Flip the 
            pancake over and cook for 1-2 mins on the other side. 
            Repeat with the 
            remaining batter, keeping the pancakes warm in a low 
            oven.
        </li>
        <li>Stack the pancakes on plates and top with the banana 
            slices, a glug of sticky maple syrup and a 
            handful of pecan nuts, if you like.
   </ol>
